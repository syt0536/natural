   <p>2.In the search page, users can search various keywords, such as compound name and target type and derivative id. 
     Users can also search for attributes. You can enter a range of one to five attributes, such as alogp and molecule weight and hbd and hba and rtb. 
     In the two boxes, enter the minimum and maximum values in sequence.

   <p>Alternatively, users can search a specific structure by sketching it in the JME applet window. 
     Users can specify structure types for query, such as substructure search and similarity search, and MMP click the “Search” button to deliver a query molecule to Server. 
     The bioactive molecules are returned with 3D similar to query molecule.

   <p>3.In the tools page, users can utilise the SEA online computing algorithm tool to predict possible targets of a query molecule by clicking the “Target Prediction” sub-menu.
      Users can sketch a structure in the JME applet window or input a molecule in SMILES format into the “SMILES” txt box as the query, 
      and provide a valid e-mail address for receiving results and click “Target Prediction” button to submit a job. 
      The potential protein targets results will be sent to you email.
